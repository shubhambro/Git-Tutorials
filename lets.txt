6.We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

			SELECT (months*salary) as earnings, COUNT(*) FROM Employee
			GROUP BY earnings ORDER BY earnings DESC limit 1;
			
7.Query the following two values from the STATION table:

			select round(sum(lat_n),2), round(sum(lat_w),2)
			from station;


8.Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than  and less than . Truncate your answer to  decimal places.
				
				
				SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N), 4) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > 38.7880 AND LAT_N < 137.2345;


9.Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than . Truncate your answer to  decimal places.
			
				
				select round(LAT_N, 4)
				from station
